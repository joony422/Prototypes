# Prototype 1 

## The Game 
**PLANET ROCK**

## The Concept - 

* Kids have to travel around the universe collecting award trophies from different planets.
* Each planet has it's own lesson plan and activity. i.e - they will learn some new sounds and concepts and then get to play a game that uses the sounds

**The main structure in each lesson is as follows -**
* Each planet has a **theme** - eg - food
* There will be a **video by K&M** that will teach the new sounds and explain the activity
* There will be an **activity that pertains to the concept**. The activities will differ for each planet (eg - Beat Machine/ Simon Says/Memory Game/Follow the leader)

## The Levels/Planets

**1. Planet Food**
* Here they will learn a new sound (eg - P) and words that use it (Pasta, Pizza etc.)
* They will use the P sounds in the beat machine and create fun tunes!

**2. Planet Animal**

**3. Planet Robot**

## Questions for Mark and Kaila - 
1) Should each planet be a different sound? Or should it be a set of sounds?
2) Does each lesson/planet have a new activity? (Beat Machine/Simon Says/Memory Game)
3) So we need stages within wach lesson? (i.e repetitions of the same activity)
